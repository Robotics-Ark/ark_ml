        retrieve it later without loading payloads (e.g., file path, shard/key,
        record index, byte offset/size, and optional metadata).
        This index allows
        `__len__` and `__getitem__` to be fast and memoryâ€‘efficient by deferring
        actual I/O until access time.

        Notes:
